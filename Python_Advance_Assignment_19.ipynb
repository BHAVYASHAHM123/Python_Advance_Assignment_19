        "Ans) Suppose we are implementing a class that you want to act like a number via operator overloading.So we implement __add__ in your class, and now expressions like obj + 10 is acceptable.This is because obj + 10 is interpreted as obj.__add__(10), and the custom method __add__ can do whatever it means to add 10 to custom class. However, what about an expression like 10 + obj which is really (10).__add__(myobj)?  The 10 is an instance of a Python built-in type and its __add__ method doesn't know anything about the new type,obj, so it will return a error NotImplemented.To handle such scenarios, __radd__ is used. Python will first try (10).__add__(myobj),and if that returns NotImplemented, Python will check if the right-hand operand implements __radd__, and if it does, it will call obj.__radd__(10) rather than raising a TypeError."
